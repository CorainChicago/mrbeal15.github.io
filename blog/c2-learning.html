      Due to DBC's intense curriculum, I feel that it is beneficial to really understand how each of us learns, and how to use those learning styles to maximize our effiency. Since we are learning an abdunant amount of new information in an extremely short period of time, understanding what learning strategies work best will help in approaching problems and solving those problems in given amount of time.

       Prior to starting Phase 0, we were required to determine our learning styles. There were two perceptual qualities that combined with one of two ordering abilities. There was the concrete perceptual quality that bases everything off of your 5 senses, and takes an "it is what it is" attitude. There is also an abstract perceptual quality that takes the attitude of "it's not always what it seems", and uses more intuition and imagination than concrete feelings such as one's five senses to approach problems. These two qualities combined with two abilities, random and sequential, give us a specific learning. As you would think random thinkers are able to complete tasks in chunks but not in any specific order. Sequential is the opposite, where things have to be completed in a linear fashion. For me, I am a concrete-random/abstract-sequential learner. I do best when I can experiment to find the answer, especially through trial and error. This was especaily true this week doing the Ruby challenges, as I had to use a lot of trial and error to make sure that the tests all passed in each of the challenges.The one thing that I noticed on the description of a concrete-random learners is that they have trouble keeping detailed records, which is absolutely true. As hard as I try to keep the exact time I spend on each challenge, what always ends up happening is me going back over the challenge to just look at, but end up working another hour or so on it, and not logging the time. One of the things that I have been trying to work on is being more organized whether that is timeboxing, or keeping better track of everything that I have done.

       According to Carol Dweck, there are two mindsets that one can have: a growth mindset and a fixed mindset. If you haven't taken a look at any articles regarding the two, I suggest you do. A fixed mindset, although extremely common, is detrimental to anyone who strives to be better. A fixed mindset is one that believes that you can only prove your intelligence through success. It believes that you have to prove your intelligence by never failing, and that you must strive for success, otherwise you won't seem intelligent. On the surface this seems like a reasonable mindset to take, except for the fact that you focus all of your time and energy on not failing in order to prove something to others. Let's be honest though, no one likes to fail. No one enjoys losing. It's in these moments of failure and loss that one with a growth mindset thrives and one with a fixed mindest might not. A growth mindset sees failure as an opportunity to learn. Someone with a growth mindset doesn't feel the need to prove their intelligence by never losing, but seizes opportunities that may seem unsurmountable as a way to develop themselves and grow. It is definitely difficult to take on the growth mindset, because again, WHO LIKES TO LOSE? However, understanding that our failures do not define us, and remembering that each time that we lose or fail, it just shows us that we have more to learn and that we have room to grow. I think there is a happy medium between a fixed mindset and a growth mindset where one strives to find success, but isn't discouraged along the way when there are obstacles and set backs. I'm just trying to find that happy medium.

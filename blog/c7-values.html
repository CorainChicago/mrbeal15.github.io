      When challenges arise, and one finds themselves in the face of adversity, a person's true character is revealed, and I believe their values are a good part of their character. DBC is going to be the most challenging thing that I have attempted to date. Not only will I be attempting to go through an extremely difficult curriculum in a finite amount of time, I will be moving from a relatively small city to a major metropolis in Chicago. During this time, I will have to depend on a my core values to get me through, but mainly self-reliance, will-power and creativity. Although I will be in a group facing similar struggles as myself, I will have to rely on myself ultimately to succeed. Will-power is another value that will influence the level of success that I find. Being able to dig down deep and find that drive and energy to keep going in the face of adversity is something that I have done in the past, and I am, in a twisted sort of way, looking forward to being able to do again. Having been an athlete the majority of my life, I'm accustomed to finding that inner strength when things are getting tough and finding that drive to push myself to the finish line. I think that will-power will be one of the most important values during my time at DBC.

      Recently, I had a friend as me for advice in dealing with a new job. His job is comparable to mine, and so I felt like I was qualified in giving him advice.I basically told him that it comes down to how you want to program to be run, and that how much his programs succeed ultimately comes down to how much work he's willing to put forth into it. Self-reliance is definitely a big piece of it. Not waiting for someone else to solve the problem, but to identify the problem, and then find your own solution is key.

      While at DBC, I think one of the most important things that I will need to do when facing a problem or burnout, is to take a step back and look at the bigger picture. Look how far I have been able to come, and look at where I want to be. It's definitely going to take some will-power, but like I mentioned earlier, it's not something that I am afraid of.

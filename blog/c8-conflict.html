  <h2>Conflict</h2>

      Up until last week, I was the Sports Director at the local YMCA. A good portion of my job was conflict resolution. Whether it was the parent who was upset that their child's soccer coach canceled practice, or the adult who missed their basketball game because they didn't see the schedule change. Whether it was my fault or not, it didn't matter, I still received the blame. In these situations, I would become angry or irritated because I felt like the time and effort that I put into organizing and running the leagues wasn't appreciated, and that the person complaining was either ungrateful or unaware of just how hard it is to get everybody on the same page. The more leagues I ran though, the less I let it bother me. I began to realize that majority of the time, people just need to blow off steam, and that although one or two people might complain, there were 300 other families who were not. It really came down to understanding that no matter what you, you're not going to make everyone happy and in conflict not letting reactionary emotions hi-jack your demeanor, but taking a step back, listening, and then trying to see both sides.

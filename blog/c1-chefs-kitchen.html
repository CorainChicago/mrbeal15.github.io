  <h1>Intro to DBC</h1>
  <h2>My thoughts on Phase 0 and the Culture</h2>

    <p>In doing my research leading up to and deciding to attend DBC, I noticed that the curriculum went past just learning how to code. DBC isn't just about learning a skill, but changing how you approach problems, and how one truly learns. In the Kitchen vs Table analogy, I took the table as sort of the traditional educational route. You go to grade school, then middle school, then high school. Then you pay for college, get through college and you're on your way. Whereas the kitchen is a little more hands on, a lot less structured and ultimately in the hands of those in the kitchen, which so far describes DBC to the T. I have always found myself learning more efficiently when I am doing something rather than being taught something via being lectured at, which was one of the driving forces in me choosing DBC. I also love the idea that each cohort is sort of "in it together". Having participated heavily in sports from age 5 through 2 years of college, the idea of teamwork has been fully engrained in my being. It is true that you are only as strong as your weakest link and that when things start to get tough, you have to depend on those that are in the trenches with you. I think this aligns pretty well with the culture at DBC. My understanding is that we will have the resources available if we do get stuck, but relying on the people in the cohort and in the trenches is how we are going to get through it. I have always been one to accept challenges, although I would be lying if I said I wasn't terrified of the challenge accepted in attending DBC. One of the things that I have been trying to remind myself is that you learn most from failure, not from success. That failure doesn't mean that you can't accomplish something, it just means you have more to learn. So far my expectations haven't changed much. I can say it has been a relief to finally start, and see the initial nature of the beast. I am definitely excited to start, and I absolutely cannot wait to get on campus. I just need to remind myself to not take this time for granted, and to learn all that I can now so that the transition, although will be rough, won't be impossible.

  <h2>Stereotype Threat</h2>
  <h4>9/6/15</h4>

      Stereotype threat and the impostor syndrome were pretty interesting studies. Although I didn't get to go as deep as I had wanted, I feel like I have a pretty good grasp of both ideas, I'm just not sure how to completely remedy them.

      Stereotype threat basically occurs whenever you are given a difficult task, and due to a negative perception of an identity of yours, whether it be gender/race/whatever, causes you to under performs due to the identity's overall perception. For example, in Claude Steele's presentation he spoke about African American students were given a test in three different forms, an IQ test, a standardized test, and a puzzle. When it came to the IQ test, and standardized test, African American students underperformed in comparison to the scores of white students. However, when there wasn't an emphasis on the test or race, and the test was administered in the form of a puzzle, their scores were quite comparable. Mr. Steele basically hypothesized that we let negative stereotypical perceptions of certain groups dictate how we perform in difficult situations. It's like we fall to the occasion rather than rising. If the group that we identify with isn't good at music, then when given a task music related, especially if difficult, we under perform.

      Impostor syndrome deals with the same issues, and is something that I keep having to try to talk myself out of. It basically deals with the anxiety that comes when you don't look like the stereotypical _______. If you asked a pool of people what a stereotypical coder looked like, I probably wouldn't fit the mold of that image. I'm a tall, African-American male who played sports the majority of my life. Does it mean that I can't find success in coding? Absolutely not. But it does add an additional layer of pressure whenever I run into a problem while coding. Because I don't look like that stereotypical coder, I feel like I can't ever stumble, be behind, or not understand something, because then I'll be found out to not be that coder, and if I feel like I'm not 'that' coder, then my peers must feel the same way as well.

      Impostor syndrome and the stereotype threat both are powered by self doubt. Once you start doubting yourself, and you think that you don't fit the mold of the stereotypical ____(fill in the blank) you subconsciously under perform, and you're not able to reach that maximum potential. Although I have yet to find a fool-proof way to dispel the thought that I'm not a coder or that I am an impostor, I try to constantly remind myself that I am more than my outward appearance. That, what I look like doesn't define my ceiling, and that with effort anything is possible. Also reminding myself that EVERYONE that goes through DBC is going to struggle, and EVERYONE is going to be lost, make a mistake, feel defeated at some point in the program.

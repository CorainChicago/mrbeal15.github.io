  <h2>Version Control, git, and GitHub</h2>

    <p>One of the larger ideas that we had to work with this first week, was version control systems and how to utilize one. A version control system, is a system in which you are able to upload your files, projects, etc to a repository on a centralized remote server. Any time that you modify the repository in any way a copy of the repository is created. The version control system also saves the original copy of the repository and any other modified versions. Since the repository is located on a remote server and not just a local machine, in the event that the repository is deleted or corrupted, you can always access not just the last copy that was saved, but also the original repository. Another feature of version control systems is that they can be accessed remotely and by multiple people simultaneously. If you were working in a group, you can all work on a project at the same time regardless of where you are located and any changes that are made, can be updated on everyone's local machine (more on this in the next section). The benefits of utilizing VCSs seem to be abundant, and having just scratched the surface, I'm curious as to what other features they offer.</p>
    <p>So in relation to version control systems, git is the software on your local machine that communicates with the VCS's. In our case, the VCS that we will be using is GitHub. As long as you have an internet connection, you can access any repository that you have access to on GitHub. Git is ran in the terminal using simple commands. One of the features of git is that you can set up remotes. Remotes are basically urls that tell you where you want to get changes in the repository from and where you want to send any changes. Any time a file in the repository is modified on your local machine, git notes it. In the terminal, if you run $ git status, it will show you any modified files as well as any new files. There are three stages files can be in in git, working, stage, and committed. Modified files will be in the working stage. Once you have modified the file and saved it on the local machine, if you run $ git status, it will tell you the files that have been modified and still need to be added to the stage. Files that are staged or added mean that they are ready to be saved in the repository or committed. To commit a file, run $ git commit. This will open your default text editor and require you to enter a commit message. The commit message can be a brief description of what you changed or it can be a detailed description. Either way, it needs to explicitly show what has been modified. Once all modified and new files have been added and committed, you'll need to push them to the VCS or GitHub in our instance. To do so you'll enter $ git push name_of_your_remote branch_you_were_working_on (branches are used so that you don't alter the best version of the project which should be located on the master branch). Terminal will then prompt you for your github username and password and then it will upload the new version of the repository to GitHub. To make sure that your repository on your local machine is up-to-date, you'll want to use the fetch command, $ git fetch name_of_your_remote and that will download the latest master branch onto your local machine.</p>

      As mentioned earlier, GitHub is sort of a fail-proof storage place for code. Not only does it protect your code if your computer is lost, stolen, damaged, etc it also allows you or anyone with the right credentials to access it wherever as long as they have an internet connection. It also allows you to work on a group project with multiple people without having to share a computer or storage device. One of the best features though, is the fact that every version of a project is saved so if you run into a version that doesn't work, you can always revert back to the last working version.

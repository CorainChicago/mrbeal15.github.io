      This week in DBC, we worked with HTML and CSS, two very important components when it comes to building websites. If the website were a human body, HTML would be the bones, and CSS would be the skin. HTML provides the structure of the website, what text/pictures will be displayed, where they are displayed, links, and all that jazz. Whereas CSS is what provides the styling and flair. Without CSS, web pages would still be functional, they would just be extremely plain and boring.

    <p>
        In dealing with CSS, there are three parts. The selector, the property, and the value.
        For example, if I wanted to change all of the h2 headings to have a blue font I would use:

           h2 {
              color: blue;
         }

          where h2 is the selector, color is the property and blue is the value. This will turn every h2 tag in the HTML document blue. Well, what if you don't want to turn everything blue. What if I just wanted to change three h2 tags, or just one h2 tag blue? That is where classes and IDs come into play. A class is used when you want to change selected elements that share the same type tag. Like I mentioned earlier, if you have 6 h2 tags, and you want to change 3 of them to have a blue font, you can use a class, which works like this.

            In the HTML document, in the h2 tags that you would like to change blue you'll add a class attribute to those tags:

                <p> &lth2 class="blue"&gt </p>

            Everything in between the opening h2 tag and the closing h2 tag will then be given the class "blue".

            Now, in your CSS document, you'll call the class selector with a period, set the property to color, and then set the value to blue, like this:
                  .class {
                      color: blue;
                }
            Everything that has a class blue, will now have blue text.
    </p>
    <p>
        Now for IDs. IDs are a little different in that they have a heavier specificity value than classes and can only be applied to one unique element. So unlike our h2 tags with the class of blue, we would only be able to change one h2 element to blue. This makes it easier to change, for instance, one of the blue h2 elements without changing them all. Say that we wanted to make one of the three h2 tags have a bold font, but not the other two. This is when an ID would come in handy. Since an ID has a higher specificity value, it would take precedence over the class. We would set it like this:

             <p>&lth2 id="bold"&gt</p>

        and everything between this h2 tag and the closing one will be bold.

        In the CSS document we call the bold id like this:
            #id {
              color: blue;
              font-weight: bold;
          }
        This will give the h2 element with the ID of bold, a bold text.
    </p>

    <p>
      One of the creeds that developers live by is D.R.Y, Don't Repeat Yourself. Classes allow you to apply a certain style to multiple elements without going and changing each individual element. IDs come in handy when you have one element that you would like to style, since you can only apply a certain ID to just one element.

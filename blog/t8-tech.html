      In my early stages of research of DBC, and what materials we would be learning, I often came across Ruby on Rails. I understood that Ruby was a programming language, but I was unsure how Ruby on Rails differed from the actual language. In doing a little bit of reading on Ruby on Rails, I found that they are quite different. While Ruby is the programming language, Ruby on Rails is a web application framework.
    </p>
    <p>
        Ruby on Rails is basically a starter kit for web applications. It provides you with what it believes each web application needs at it's core. In doing so, it ensures that all applications built using Ruby on Rails, on a basic level, are similar and use the same conventions. Ruby on Rails is an opinionated software, which means that it makes basic assumptions that there is a best way to do things, and it is designed to encourage those best practices, and discourages any alternatives.
    </p>
    <p>
       Ruby on Rails, from my basic understanding, uses an MVC software pattern. 'M' referring to model, 'V' to view, and 'C' to controller. These three parts are interconnected to make the applications run.<br>

       The user uses the controller to manipulate the model, which updates what the user sees in the view. Think about the diagram as a text editor. The user uses the keyboard to type in a sentence, which manipulates the model(the document), and displays the changes on the view(the updated document).  </p>

       <p>
        I think the biggest advantage to using Ruby on Rails is the fact that it automates the basic code needed to create an application. It not only saves time from having to create those files, but it also ensures that each Ruby on Rails project is created the same way, which makes debugging, that much easier. I am definitely excited to learn more about Ruby on Rails, and to start using it to build projects.

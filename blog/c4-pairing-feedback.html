  <h2>Pairing and Feedback</h2>

      Part of Dev Bootcamp's remote portion of the program are the pairing sessions, where cohort mates will meet via skype and work through a challenge together with one person being the driver(the one manning the keyboard) and another person being a navigator(the one looking up methods, and other documentation). These pairing sessions definitely took, and are still taking some getting used to. It is really nice to have someone to work through challenges with, especially the harder ones, but pairing with someone through video call presents it's challenges. One emotion that I think we have all felt at some point during one of our pairing sessions is frustration. Frustration usually arises whenever someone else is driving due to their pace, or you wanting to test certain code without having a plan. It definitely is taking some practice to find a balance where you're able to contribute, but also not dominate the pairing session with your ideas. One thing that I try to remember is that I can always get something out of a pairing session. Whether I am on the same level, a little ahead or a little behind, I should benefit each time I pair. Obviously, if the person is more advanced I can learn, but having to teach certain points to someone who might be a little behind is a great way to solidify subjects learned.

      I love receiving feedback as it is vital to my growth as a developer. I think the hardest part is leaving feedback. As of yet, I haven't really had any criticisms of my partners except for suggesting headphones, or trying to find a place away from outside noise. Everyone thus far has done a good job of collaborating.

      There definitely is a little bit of vulnerability when pairing or reading feedback. Not knowing the person you pair with is a little nerve racking, but remembering to go into the pair session with the mindset that regardless of how advanced they are, I can improve whether it's by learning from them or by helping them understand something. Feedback is sort of the same way. Of course you want to hear everything that you did well, but it's what you didn't do well that helps one improve.

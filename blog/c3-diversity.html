  <h2>Diversity within the Tech Industry</h2>

      For me personally, a career in the tech industry was never something that crossed my mind. I think there is this stereotypical person that the general public has when it comes to describing what someone in the tech industry looks like, not to mention their intelligence. Unfortunately, I never saw myself as someone who fit that mold mainly because I always thought of someone who could code, or build websites, or knew programming languages as ridiculously smart. Not that there isn't a certain aptitude that one must possess, but I thought of it more as something that I could never attain. It wasn't until I started taking little ruby courses online that I realized that it was something that I enjoyed, and sort of had a mind for. Granted, I am one person and I don't necessarily represent the other members of my race, but I think that my perception isn't an uncommon one.

        When looking at statistics, African-Americans comprise a very small percentage of employees in the tech industry, and I think it has to do with access. Like I mentioned earlier, I think the perception of what a "typical coder" looks like, is what is keeping people from trying to enter the field. However, I don't think it's the only cause for under-representation. Education, across the board, needs to address the boom in the tech industry. Granted, there are a lot of new programs that are geared towards starting kids coding earlier and earlier. However, these programs don't extend into predominantly African-American and Latino communities, where computers aren't in every household. I think if programs that were captivating of youths were available to them on a wider scale, we'd see some improvement in representation by these under-represented groups. It definitely has to do with the overall view of education, but I think if people were made aware of coding bootcamps, and other online tutorials, and they saw that you don't have to be a genius to be successful, more people would pursuit a career in a technological field. When diversity becomes more equal, and everyone feels like they have a voice and that they are represented in the grand scheme of things, everything will improve and I think people will be more comfortable when dealing with other cultures.

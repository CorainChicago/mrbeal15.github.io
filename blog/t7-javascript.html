      I would be lying if I said that switching from Ruby to Javascript was effortless. For as much as the two languages are similar, they are definitely miles a part. A common theme in checking in with my partners during pairing sessions this week was that the logic is still pretty much the same, it's just getting the syntax down that's the tricky part. Ruby and Javascript are, to my knowledge, capable of doing the same things, it's just getting there that causes difficulty.

      A lot of the challenges that we had to do this week, required us to loop over a data structure in JavaScript. In Ruby there are a multitude of different ways to do this, but the most common way is to use the each method, or some sort of variance of it. However, things in Javascript weren't that simple. I found myself using a lot of for statements and looping through the data structures that way. Although at first, it wasn't as easy and straightforward as Ruby's methods, after practice they became easier. I don't necessarily see an advantage to iterating over a structure in Javascript, except for modifying the increments. So if you wanted to select every third element in the data structure, rather than having to add piece of code after you use the each method in Ruby, you can set the for loop to (i = 0; while i < data.length; i += 3).

        One of the major disadvantages to using Javascript vs. Ruby is the lack of error support. In Ruby, if there is any type of error, Ruby can precisely tell you where the error occurred and what type of error it was, so fixing the errors in Ruby is fairly easy. The same cannot be said for Javascript. In fact, it could be the polar opposite in Javascript. They do give you the error line, but I found, more times than not, the error messages were extremely vague, leaving me to guess how to fix the code.

        Although Ruby is a little more user friendly, Javascript is capable of a few things that I'm not sure that Ruby can do. One of the first features that I found Javascript could do, but Ruby couldn't was the prompt/alert. Prompt will open a box in the browser and get an input from the user, and alert will open a dialogue box and display a message to the user. I'm not sure if Ruby is capable of doing this. These two functions came in handy whenever I was building my game. The only issue with them is that they can't be performed in terminal so I was constantly having to copy and paste code into the browser console. Even with these two features, I still think Ruby is a more intuitive programming language, and I'm definitely curious to see how it compares to other languages now.
